# Vendure Gatsby Storefront

This is a storefront app built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) and powered by [Vendure](https://www.vendure.io/).

## Status

This repo is the result of ~4 hours experimentation. I've never used Gatsby before and have almost zero React experience. Therefore the code is probably not ideal. No worry, it is a nice proof-of-concept which I'll develop further and clean up.

So far there is a list/detail view of products and the ability to add products to the cart.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn` or `npm install`
3. `yarn develop` or `npm run develop`
